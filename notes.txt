giskard
- 9   | ziggy:   names from level 8 on the floor are names of people who have passed through, his idea to write down, he lacks intuition, he'll never make it
- 20  | lisa:    "i've heard he likes writing on the walls, but i've never met him so far"
- 28  | murdock: thinks fast and tries to help everyone, he said should write names down, he found out about an appointment
- 31  | samara:  'too smart must be eliminated'
sukeena
- 9   | ziggy:   unsure if she exists, there are traces of her though...
- 20  | lisa:    she owns the house and invented all the things in Rose Red, including the room i'm in, 'she must be a cruel one', but lisa hasn't met her to her knowledge
- 28  | murdock: sukeena is male, didn't give him (murdock) any info, kept saying he had to find laura, says sukeena exists but his existence is pointless
murdock
- 9   | ziggy:   bad memory, place he lived 'much worse than this', can 'make reality "change"'
- 20  | lisa:    stopped by once and explained that there is a place with buttons where if someone presses wrong one, they're instantly teleported to the room lisa is in
                 she could leave if someone pressed the button and also ended up in the room, he couldn't remember where it was, never made her suffer or went back
- 28  | murdock: thinks his own name is murdock, has terrible headaches, thinks turning things (altering reality) was a lot easier at home, something about eternal night but sun rose
                 someone told him entire reality is dying and he could reverse things and that it would be easy for him, then night came and he woke up here, was a man who talked to him
                 he's very forgetful so he writes down the things he learns
                 name is j. murdock, came from the 'da-'
aneninen
- 9   | ziggy:   said to be the creator of EBONY, but ziggy doubts this
- 20  | lisa:    heard she's the one who created EBONY
- 28  | murdock: comes from africa long ago, used to be maid-servant in rose red and now she owns rose red (a different one?)
                 first one to arrive in EBONY but her existence is unproven
                 i ask if murdock is sure about aneninen, and he asks if things have changed again
- 31  | samara:  creater of ebony / its ironic since ebony is smarter than him
                 ebony is out of control now but that shall change
lisa
- 9   | ziggy:   'she gets into deep trouble too easy'
- 20  | lisa:    not sure how long she's in there, got in there by pushing a button, someone (not yxonumei?) gave her a bunch of drawing pins once, yxonumei said she should keep them
                 yxonumei visists frequently to push the button to cause her pain, but she's not the only one, the others remain nameless
- 28  | murdock: no idea who lisa is but her name is familiar
- 31  | samara:  'i love hurting her, she is so vulnerable,' / 'and i am not the only one who loves her desperate screams'
laura
- 9   | ziggy:   i'll meet her when water is darkest, ziggy thinks murdock told him that
- 20  | lisa:    'someone told me before that she was stuck like me, though I don't know where, poor Laura, i hope she's all right'
- 28  | murdock: sukeena was searching for laura desperately
- 31  | samara:  'tiny light caught in middle of sea of darkness, must be destroyed'
yxonumei
- 9   | ziggy:   afaik she came right before ziggy, little girl but creepily mature
- 20  | lisa:    vell and creepy voice, sounds like a 12 y.o. but w/o anything nice in her voice, plays w/ lisa until she passes out
                 'belladonna' is password to glasswall apparently is how yxonumei leaves
- 28  | murdock: thinks that yxonumei is not a little girl at all, she said she had just been free from some horribly painful thing
                 she talked about endless suffering or something without any emotion, not even the joy of being free again, has a feeling she can tune as well
- 31  | samara:  'a pity that she got out'
ziggy
- 9   | ziggy:   wants to answer some questions about why he's here, what this place is, etc.
- 20  | lisa:    was here once, told her about yxonumei's addition to the plaque
- 28  | murdock: knows as much as i about him
- 31  | samara:  he's too curious / you're too curious as well
samara
- 9   | ziggy:   never met her and hopes he never will
- 20  | lisa:    doesn't know who she is
- 28  | murdock: "isn't she the one who keeps torturing yxonumei?"
th-ts
- 9   | ziggy:   doesn't know anything about him or her
- 20  | lisa:    'someone told me something about her, oh my, what was it? she never speaks, only sneaks, or something like that.'
- 28  | murdock: 'she never speaks, only sneaks but you know more about her than me', i met her last time i was here (was she the one who knocked me out?)
- 31  | samara:  'thief'
ebony
- 9   | ziggy:   EBONY is a mixture of absurd alternative realities, sukeena's house is one of the meeting points of EBONY, everyone is there at least once
- 20  | lisa:    it is a vast place, plenty of traps and has its own logic, someone told her it was made for keeping ideas and people away from reality and that it was a backup because 'normal reality started to fade away'
- 28  | murdock: maybe sukeena created EBONY
- 31  | samara:  out of control / but she enjoys it
111825
- 28  | murdock: that is the time of something he does not remember
- 31  | samara:  you will never find out
password
- 28  | murdock: "it is changing but not randomly once you've found it out you can get every consecutive word with a little sense"
time
- 20  | lisa:    murdock told her that that's the time
- 28  | murdock: time is mismatched, terrible things can happen if two meet but are not in the same time

      remember people: thin young man with messy white hair (nervous about something), strange girl carrying huge spear (watered her)

    - all colors disappear and silhouette of dark exceptionally thin woman appears, 'your nightmare is about to start', i can hear her thoughts in my mind
      says we all made her suffer so now we will pay for it, does something to halle and she drops, horrible pictures fill my mind
      she says why should she stop / only the beginning AND no one asked her how she felt / things will never change she will never change

      looking at it causes fear

    - middle of ghost feast or something like that, insubstantial creatures are dancing, music is menacing
      dance stops when they spot me, female one tells me a scary rhyme, then they continue dancing without music
31  /gwenn/wraith.html
    - 'your nightmare is about to start now', silhouette of dark thin women appeared out of nowhere, hearing her thoughts in my mind
      she claims i made her suffer and that i'll pay for it, she says i didn't stop and she will never stop either
      she does some stuff to me and puts disturbing images in my head, she seems really disturbed...

    - she floats next time me, horrible image in my mind, i pass out
32  /zelda/dis.html
    - time passed, i was unconscious and dreaming, i wake up to a hot room, it hurts its so hot
      no way out, section of wall consists of jelly-like matter, floor has text 'it's over, nothing works'
      am distressed, achieved nothing after long journey, fed up with EBONY
    > /zelda/ted.html, no answer since no one is here
    > /zelda/enchanted.html, you're missing the first part
33  /zelda/disenchanted.html
    - run headlong into jelly, i break through, underwater now, tiny shiny bubbles glowing in the darkness, little pieces of jelly aggregate and form large jellyfish
      they float around me but mean no harm, 'two of them are telling lies' says one of the medusas
    > /zelda/medusa.html OR /zelda/medusas.html OR /zelda/jellyfish.html, not the first one they've met, i should focus on bubbles, i am deep underwater, deep below surface of EBONY
      they guess that i have met samara, and they know her
34  /zelda/downbythewater.html
    - keep swimming a while and get lost, dark and no point of reference, after some time i see the contour of a building (or where i think are walls), should try to enter
    > zelda/4714.html, 4714n715
35  /zelda/atlantis.html
    - i'm in the building, bit more light here, i see the remains of a large stone building, i would approach it but a deep voice stops me and says i can't enter
    > /zelda/dragon.html, what kind of dragon
36  /zelda/waterdragon.html
    - 'you can go if you wish, but don't expect too much'
      i've never seen the dragon only heard its voice
      i see staircase, either i swim or walk, but i'm unsure about it, where do i want to go anyways?
37  /zelda/allthesame.html
    - take random direction, find small odd-looking glowing cave, currents are different here, the water comes from the strange cavern, perhaps i should investigae more thoroughly

    - after a short while thick vegetation blocks my way, should find safe path through it somehow, if i enter now i'll probably lose my way
39  /zelda/recapitulation.html
    - enter artificial looking entrance to find a corridor, seems like these hallways look the same in EBONY even underwater
      glasswall in front of me can only be activated by touch-pad on panel

    - end of corridor, after a right turn i find a dead end, in this very case the solution seems to be palpable, huge black button with a 'click here' message awaits me
      this one must be easy, way too easy
41  /zelda/rickrolled.html
    - finally above water, though i've reached the surface it seems i must dive down once again since there are only two exists out of the antique court i've arrived and both lead down
      both are covered by closed grates
    > /zelda/findurplace.html, map of EBONY, shows places and people, map went wrong somehow, most parts unreadable but could still reveal something

    > climb down but invisible force pulls me back, direction of falling changes, i think gravity keeps changing, reach some kind of metallic grind, really bizarre place
43  /zelda/beansidhe.html
    - no idea how i left that previous place, new place doesn't make much more sense, walking along a pipeline, few meters below me it doesn't exist, maybe it's time to find out something unexpected...
44  /zelda/wayeasy.html
    - end up behind closed door and picture attached to wall, no absurd things in this room

    - outdoors again, landscape reminds me of some places i saw long before rose red, maybe i'm in one of the ourter regions of EBONY
      open gate in front of me, i enter, leads into huge labyrinth, roam for half an hour only to end up at entrance, should find a guide before entering again

12  /celia/dreamy.html
    - elevator stops, as i exit the machine goes down a bit and stops functioning, no way out not even a door
      clearly haven't lost my way, graffiti on wall shows that others have been here before

    > /celia/lookup.jpg, 'showtime' on ceiling
14  /celia/showtime.html
    - sight is back but as i reach corner think and wet fog arrives from right, large picture with title missing, title xiv suggests there might be more of them somewhere
      image is of taro card
15  /celia/temperance.html
    - 'my friends have lost their way' written backwards on wall, j on wall, fog somewhat dissipates, stairs on left but seems to be dead-end
16  /celia/bluejayway.html
    - climbing up endless looking stairs, it ends with darkened glass wall blocking the end, someone attached plaques with letters on stairs but didn't finish the job
